# [IP Creepr](https://ip-creepr.herokuapp.com/)

With this app, you'll be able to track IP's all over the world. IP Creepr is powered by [Abstract IP Geolocation API](https://www.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation-api) and [LeafLet](https://leafletjs.com/) along with [React Leaftlet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for Map functions.

Enjoy :)

## How to run...
1. Create a [Abstract IP Geolocation API](https://www.abstractapi.com/ip-geolocation-api) account and get an API key.
2. Add key to .env to hide the key from the public.
3. Clone or [download](https://github.com/jamesjkim88/IP-Creepr/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repo.
4. Run `npm install` on correct location of your project via terminal.
5. After packages have been installed run `npm start` to start the app.
